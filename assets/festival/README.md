This directory contains test data for testing and (de)serialization purposes, but only `Frontend`-specific files.

Folders & files are laid out in the same way as the real files, with this folder serving as `Festival`'s project root, i.e, this folder is `~/.local/share/festival`.

All `shukusai` data structures are located at `../shukusai`.

So instead of `gui/state/collection.bin`, it is located at `../shukusai/state/collection.bin`.
