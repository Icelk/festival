# Collection1
This is version 1 of the `Collection`.

This code and data definitions exist here solely for backwards compatibility.

Things added in `v2` that need conversion from `v1`:
	- `key: ArtistKey` in `Artist`
	- `key: AlbumKey` in `Album`
	- `key: SongKey` in `Song`
	- `genre: Option<Arc<str>>` in `Album`
