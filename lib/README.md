## Libraries
These are some personal libraries that I'll _eventually_ turn into public crates.

| Library       | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| `disk`        | (De)serializing various file formats to/from disk
| `disk_derive` | Derive macro for `disk`, e.g: `#[derive(Toml)]`
| `human`       | Displaying human readable numbers & time
| `rolock`      | Read-Only-Lock
