# Media Controls
`festivald` will hook into the OS's native media controls to display some metadata and allow for playback via the OS's interface or via keyboard play/pause/stop/etc signals.

This is enabled by default and can be disabled with the [`media_controls`](config.md) config option or the [`--disable-media-controls`](command-line/command-line.md) command-line flag.
