Options:
  -f, --festivald <URL>
          URL of the `festivald` to connect to
          
          The protocol, IPv4 address, and port of the
          `festivald` that `festival-cli` will connect
          to by default.
          
          Protocol must be:
            - http
            - https
          
          IP address must be IPv4.
          
          Default is: `http://127.0.0.1:18425`

  -t, --timeout <SECONDS>
          Set a timeout for a non-responding `festivald`
          
          If `festivald` does not respond with _at least_
          a basic HTTP header within this time (seconds),
          `festival-cli` will disconnect.
          
          0 means never disconnect.

  -i, --id <ID>
          The `JSON-RPC 2.0` ID to send to `festivald`.
          
          See below for more info:
          <https://jsonrpc.org/specification>

  -a, --authorization <USER:PASS or FILE>
          Authorization sent to `festivald`
          
          This matches the `authorization` config
          in `festivald`, see here for more info:
          <https://docs.festival.pm/daemon/authorization/authorization.html>
          
          A `festivald` with `HTTPS` or `.onion` must be
          used or `festival-cli` will refuse to start.
          
          An empty string disables this feature.
          
          Alternatively, you can input an absolute PATH to a file
          `festival-cli` can access, containing the string, e.g:
          ```
          authorization = "/path/to/user_and_pass.txt"
          ```
          
          In this case, `festival-cli` will read the file and attempt
          to parse it with the same syntax, i.e, the file should contain:
          ```
          my_user:my_pass
          ```

  -p, --proxy <PROXY>
          Route connections through a proxy
          
          Requests/responses will be routed via this proxy.
          
          Supported proxies are: `HTTP`, `SOCKS4`, and `SOCKS5`.
          
          The input must be:
            - Proxy protocol (`http://`, `socks4://`, `socks5://`)
            - Proxy IP
            - Proxy port
          
          For example: `festival-cli --proxy socks5://127.0.0.1:9050`

  -d, --debug
          Print debug information about the config/request/response

      --confirm-no-tls-auth
          Allow `--authorization` even without TLS
          
          This will let you set the authorization
          setting even if TLS is disabled.
          
          This means your `user:pass` will be sent in clear-text HTTP,
          unless you are wrapping HTTP in something else, like SSH
          port forwarding, or Tor.

      --dry-run
          Print debug information, but don't actually connect to `festivald`
          
          This implies `--debug`.

      --docs
          Open `festival-cli` documentation locally in browser

      --delete
          Delete all `festival-cli` files that are on disk
          
          This deletes all `cli` Festival folders.
          The PATHs deleted will be printed on success.

      --path
          Print the PATHs used by `festival-cli`
          
          All data saved by `festival-cli` is saved in these directories.
          For more information, see: <https://docs.festival.pm/cli/disk.html>

  -r, --reset-config
          Reset the current `festival-cli.toml` config file to the default
          
          Exits with `0` if everything went ok, otherwise shows error.

  -m, --methods
          Print all the JSON-RPC methods available

  -v, --version
          Print version

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')
