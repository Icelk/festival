A unique `Album` owned by an [`Artist`](/common-objects/artist.md).

Uniqueness is defined by the `Album`'s `title`.

`Album` objects hold [keys](/common-objects/key.md) to all of its [`Song`](/common-object/song.md)'s, acting as a relation link.

The keys inside `songs` is sorted by `Track + Disc order`.
