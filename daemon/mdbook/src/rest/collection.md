# /collection

#### ðŸŸ¢ Stable
This API is [stable](/api-stability/marker.md) since `festivald v1.0.0`.

(However, the [`collection_full`](/json-rpc/collection/collection_full.md) output is `ðŸŸ¡ Incomplete`).

---

Download _the entire_ [`Collection`](../common-objects/collection.md).

## Warning
This is the heaviest `REST` endpoint and will cause `festivald` to use at least the same amount of disk space your `Collection`'s `Song` files take up.

For example, if all your `Song`'s combined are `100GB` in size, `festivald` will use at least `100GB` in disk space when receiving this request. Further same requests will not further disk usage, depending on your [`cache_time`](../config.md) configuration.

`festivald` may also take a while to respond to the client, as it is copying, organizing, and archiving the _entire_ `Collection`.

---
