# collection_resource_size

#### ðŸŸ¢ Stable
This API is [stable](/api-stability/marker.md) since `festivald v1.0.0`.

---

View the size of the current [`Collection`](/common-objects/collection.md)'s _underlying_ resources (audio files and art).

The output of this method reflects the live audio file size, not the one at the time of the `Collection` creation. For example, if an underlying audio file is changed:
```
my_song_file.flac (5MB) -> my_song_file.flac (33MB)
```
Then this method will reflect that change.

However, `Art` is cached by `festivald` and only updated upon a `Collection` [reset](/json-rpc/collection/collection_new.md).

#### Inputs
`None`

#### Outputs

| Field | Type             | Description |
|-------|------------------|-------------|
| audio | unsigned integer | Total size of the `Collection`'s underlying audio files in bytes
| art   | unsigned integer | Total size of the `Collection`'s underlying `Album` art in bytes
