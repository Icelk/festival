# collection_new

#### ðŸŸ¢ Stable
This API is [stable](/api-stability/marker.md) since `festivald v1.0.0`.

---

Create a new [`Collection`](/common-objects/collection.md) (and replace the current one).

While this method is in progress, other `JSON-RPC` requests will be rejected.

`festivald` will respond with some stats when the `Collection` reset has finished.

The output is a superset of the [`collection_brief`](/json-rpc/collection/collection_brief.md) method.

#### Inputs

| Field | Type                                 | Description |
|-------|--------------------------------------|-------------|
| paths | optional (maybe null) array of PATHs | An array of filesystem PATHs to scan for the new `Collection`. These must be absolute PATHs **on the system `festivald` is running on**, not PATHs on the client. If `null` is provided, the default `Music` directory will be used.

#### Outputs

| Field        | Type             | Description |
|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| time         | float            | How many seconds it took `festivald` to reset AND respond
| empty        | boolean          | If the `Collection` does NOT have any `Artist`'s, `Album`'s, or `Song`'s
| timestamp    | unsigned integer | The UNIX timestamp of when this `Collection` was created
| count_artist | unsigned integer | How many unique `Artist`'s there are in this `Collection`
| count_album  | unsigned integer | How many unique `Album`'s there are in this `Collection`
| count_song   | unsigned integer | How many unique `Song`'s there are in this `Collection`
| count_art    | unsigned integer | How much unique `Album` art there are in this `Collection`

#### Example Request 1
Use default Music PATH.
```bash
festival-cli collection_new
```
```bash
curl http://localhost:18425 -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":0,"method":"collection_new","params":{"paths":null}}'
```

#### Example Request 2
Use the `PATH` /home/user/Music/collection on `festivald`'s filesystem.
```bash
festival-cli collection_new --path "/home/user/Music/collection"
```
```bash
curl http://localhost:18425 -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":0,"method":"collection_new","params":{"paths":["/home/user/Music/collection"]}}'
```

#### Example Request 3
Windows PATH works too if `\` is escaped (and if `festivald` is running on Windows).
```bash
festival-cli collection_new --path "C:\\Users\\User\\Music\\collection"
```
```bash
curl http://localhost:18425 -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":0,"method":"collection_new","params":{"paths":["C:\\Users\\User\\Music\\collection"]}}'
```

#### Example Response
