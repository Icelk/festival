Clone an existing [`Playlist`](../../common-objects/playlist.md) and all it's [`Entry`](../../common-objects/playlist.md)'s into a new one.

| len     | optional (maybe-null) unsigned integer                  | If `to` already existed (and thus, overwritten), the amount of [`Playlist Entry`](../../common-objects/playlist.md)'s it had is returned, else if it didn't exist, `null`
