# daemon_shutdown

#### ðŸŸ¢ Stable
This API is [stable](/api-stability/marker.md) since `festivald v1.0.0`.

---

Send a shutdown signal to `festivald`.

`festivald` will:
- Reject future connections
- Wait for a [`Collection`](/common-objects/collection.md) [reset](/json-rpc/collection/collection_new.md) to finish if occurring
- [Clean cache](/json-rpc/daemon/daemon_remove_cache.md)
- [Save](/json-rpc/daemon/daemon_save.md) state to disk

Then shutdown.
