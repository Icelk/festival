| queue     | array of [`Song`](../../common-objects/song.md) [keys](../../common-objects/key.md) (unsigned integers)            | Array of `Song` keys that are in the queue, in order of what will be played next
| queue_idx | optional (maybe-null) unsigned integer              | The queue index `festivald` is currently on, `null` if no `Song` is set
| playing   | boolean                                             | If `festivald` is currently playing
| song_key  | optional (maybe-null) `Song` key (unsigned integer) | The key of current `Song`, `null` if no `Song` is set
| elapsed   | unsigned integer                                    | Elapsed runtime of current `Song` in seconds
