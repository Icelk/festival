Send a signal to a `festivald` running on the same machine

This will not start a new `festivald`, but send a
signal to an already running one. This only works
if there's a `festivald` already running on the
same machine.

The flag `--disable-media-controls` disables this feature.

Usage: festivald signal OPTION [ARG]

Options:
      --play
          Start playback

      --pause
          Pause playback

      --toggle
          Toggle playback (play/pause)

      --next
          Skip to next track

      --previous
          Play previous track

      --stop
          Clear queue and stop playback

      --clear
          Clear queue but don't stop playback

      --shuffle
          Shuffle the current queue and reset to the first song

      --repeat-song
          Turn on single `Song` track repeat

      --repeat-queue
          Turn on queue repeat

      --repeat-off
          Turn off repeating

      --volume <VOLUME>
          Set the volume to `VOLUME` (0-100)

      --seek <SECOND>
          Seek to the absolute `SECOND` second in the current song

      --seek-forward <SECOND>
          Seek `SECOND` seconds forwards in the current song

      --seek-backward <SECOND>
          Seek `SECOND` seconds backwards in the current song

      --index <NUMBER>
          Set the current song to the index `NUMBER` in the queue.
          
          NOTE:
          The queue index starts from 1 (first song is `--index 1`).
          
          Providing an index that is out-of-bounds
          will end the queue (even if repeat is turned on).

      --skip <NUMBER>
          Skip `NUMBER` amount of songs
          
          If the last song in the queue is skipped over,
          and queue repeat is turned on, this will reset
          the current song to the 1st in the queue.

      --back <NUMBER>
          Go backwards in the queue by `NUMBER` amount of songs
          
          If `NUMBER` is greater than the amount of songs we can
          skip backwards, this will reset the current song to
          the 1st in the queue.
