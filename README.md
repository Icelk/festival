## Frontends
All the frontends are built on top of the internals, [`shukusai`](https://github.com/hinto-janai/festival/tree/main/shukusai).

Currently, the most full frontend implementation is [`festival-gui`](https://github.com/hinto-janai/festival/tree/main/gui) (or just called `Festival`).

## Build
<details>
<summary>General Info</summary>

---

You need [`cargo`](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) and at least `rustc 1.70`.

You also need to clone the `submodules` that include patched libraries found in [`external/`](https://github.com/hinto-janai/festival/tree/main/external):
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/hinto-janai/festival
```

Built binaries are found in `target/release/${FRONTEND_BINARY_NAME}` by default.

The repo is a workspace, with some packages shared between all `Frontend`'s, including the internals: [`shukusai`](https://github.com/hinto-janai/festival/tree/main/shukusai).

To build one of the `Frontend`'s, you must pass the `--package <FRONTEND>` option.

For example, to build `festival-gui`:
```bash
cargo build --release --package festival-gui
```
Due to some limitations, the build will error if you try to compile multiple frontends at the same time, i.e:
```bash
cargo build --release --package festival-gui --package festivald
```
will not work because `festival-gui` & `festivald` rely on mutually exclusive features within `shukusai` to work, but `cargo` only supports _additive_ features, which means things will collide. To build all `Frontends`'s, build them one at a time:
```bash
cargo build --release --package festival-gui
cargo build --release --package festivald
[ ... etc ... ]
```

<summary>Linux</summary>

---

The pre-compiled Linux binaries are built on Ubuntu 20.04, you'll need these packages to build:
```
sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev libasound2-dev libjack-dev libpulse-dev
```

To build `festival-gui`:
```
cargo build --release --package festival-gui
```

---

</details>

<details>
<summary>macOS</summary>

---

To build `festival-gui`:
```
cargo build --release --package festival-gui
```

---

</details>

<details>
<summary>Windows</summary>

---

To build `festival-gui`:
```
cargo build --release --package festival-gui
```

There is a [`build.rs`](https://github.com/hinto-janai/festival/blob/main/gui/build.rs) file in `gui/` solely for Windows-specific things:

1. It sets the icon in `File Explorer`
2. It statically links `VCRUNTIME140.dll` (the binary will not be portable without this)

## FAQ
</details>

<details>
<summary>Playlists</summary>

---

Festival does not support playlists at the moment.

---

</details>

<details>
<summary>Compilations</summary>

---

Festival does not directly support compilations (a single album, but with various artists) at the moment.

It will still load the album, but it will be spread out for each different artist.

---

</details>

<details>
<summary>Missing music</summary>

---

Your audio files must have proper metadata for Festival to detect it.

The required tags are:
- Artist
- Album

If the song title tag does not exist, the filename will be used instead.

For more details on metadata related errors, start Festival in a console:
```bash
./festival
```
and look for yellow `W` (Warn) log messages during a `Collection` reset.

---

</details>

<details>
<summary>Missing album art</summary>

---

If your audio file has embedded album art, Festival will use it.

If no embedded album art metadata is found, Festival will:
- Search in the same directory as the file for an image file
- Search in the file's parent directory for an image file

If an image file is not found, a default `?` album art will be used.

The supported image file formats are:
- `JPG/JPEG`
- `PNG`
- `BMP`
- `ICO`
- `TIFF`
- `WebP`

---

</details>

<details>
<summary>Missing date</summary>

---

Festival will look for a date metadata tag generally resembling the `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

Some examples of dates that will work:
- `2022-12-31` (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `2022` (YYYY)
- `31-12-2022` (DD-MM-YYYY)
- `12-31-2022` (MM-DD-YYYY)
- `2022/12/31` (YYYY-MM-DD but with a different separator)
- `20221231` (YYYY-MM-DD but with no separator)
- `2022-1-1` (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `2022-01-01` (YYYY-MM-DD)

As long as the year exists, the date will be parsed correctly. This means `MM-DD` metadata will be not parsed, so:
- `12-31` (MM-DD)
- `31-12` (DD-MM)

will not work. These will show up as `????-??-??` in Festival.

To fix your music metadata, see below for metadata editors.
